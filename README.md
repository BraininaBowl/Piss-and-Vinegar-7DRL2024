### Notice

I made this game almost a year ago for 7DRL2024, and in my enthousiasm for the upcoming 7DRL2025 I decided to open-source the entire thing. I'll probably be reusing some of this code, so why shouldn't you?

A traditional Roguelike made in seven days for 7DRL 2024. The game focuses on tactical, dynamic combat, strongly inspired by Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. So yes, you can kick your opponents into the scenery.

I had big plans for procedural music generation, but because of the time constraints, I had to cut that part. You'll have to fight in silence for the time being.

### Controls: 

Arrow keys/WASD/ numpad keys: Move around
T/L : Targeting mode
Enter/space: Confirm
Escape: Cancel

### Mobile:

Swipe: Move
Tap: Confirm / Switch to target mode
Two finger tap: Cancel / Switch to move mode
Tip: Use targeting mode on distant enemies and floor tiles for extra options.

### Known bugs:

* Save/load isn't working for now. I'll try and patch it in later.
* There's no victory screen. If you've defeated the boss and his pals and there's no-where to go, you've finished the game.
